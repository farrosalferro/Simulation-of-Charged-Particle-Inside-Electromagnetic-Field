This repository contains codes that I created for final project of Computer Seminar I course at Tohoku University. 

## Overview
The scripts simulate charged particles’ natural behavior when it interacts with other charged particle, a static magnetic field, and a static electric field. It also visualizes the trajectory of either a positive or negative particles governed by the existing law such as Lorentz force and Coulomb’s law. Please refer to <code>Final_Report.pdf</code> file for more detailed explanation of the program, limitation, and implementation.
